Create a 3 node kubernetes cluster using minikube and virtualbox.

Create a deployment with static PVC. This deployment will have a container that will continuously log date every 5 sec to the volume.

Deploy another deployment with dynamic PVC. This deployment will have a container that will continuously log output of top command every 10 sec to the volume.

Allow the above pods to run for few mins.

Delete the 2nd deployment (don't delete pvc) and re-create it. Verify that the data from previous iteration persists.

Create a docker image that will print all the prime numbers from 1 to 100 using python.

Create a deployment in the same cluster that will use the above docker image. Check the output using kubectl logs <pod-name>. It should output those prime numbers.
